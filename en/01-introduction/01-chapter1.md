# Getting Started

This chapter will be about getting started with Qt. At the beginning, we will explain what is Qt, then move on to some background about Qt Project, then we talk about what you can do with Qt and what is Qt Quick, finally we will write a simple project with Qt Quick. At the end of this chapter you should understand why Qt is so cool :)

## About Qt

Qt (/ˈkjuːt/ "cute", or unofficially as Q-T cue-tee) is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for developing application software with a graphical user interface (GUI) , and also used for developing non-GUI programs such as command-line tools and consoles for servers. 

### Who Use Qt?

Qt is most notably used in Autodesk Maya, The Foundry's Nuke, Adobe Photoshop Elements, Skype, VLC media player, VirtualBox, and Mathematica, and by the European Space Agency, DreamWorks, Google, HP, KDE, Lucasfilm, Panasonic, Philips, Samsung, Siemens, Volvo, Walt Disney Animation Studios and Research In Motion. The Opera web browser (up to version 10.0) also uses Qt, but only as an interface to the Linux platform.

### How Qt Works

Qt uses standard C++ but makes extensive use of a special code generator (called the Meta Object Compiler, or moc) together with several macros to enrich the language.

With the help of Qt you can write code once and deploy everywhere(almost, I will tell you later how many platforms does Qt support)

## A Short History of Qt

The Qt framework first became publicly available in May 1995. It was initially developed by Haavard Nord (Trolltech's CEO) and Eirik Chambe-Eng (Trolltech's president). Haavard and Eirik met at the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim, where they both graduated with master's degrees in computer science.

The toolkit was called Qt because the letter Q looked appealing in Haavard's Emacs font, and "t" was inspired by Xt, the X toolkit.

The first two versions of Qt had only two flavors: Qt/X11 for Unix and Qt/Windows for Windows. The Windows platform was only available under a proprietary license, which meant free/open source applications written in Qt for X11 could not be ported to Windows without purchasing the proprietary edition.

At the end of 2001, Trolltech released Qt 3.0, which added support for Mac OS X. The Mac OS X support was available only in the proprietary license until June 2003, when Trolltech released Qt 3.2 with Mac OS X support available under the GPL.

In June 2005, Trolltech released Qt 4.0.

Nokia acquired Trolltech ASA on 17 June 2008 and changed the name first to Qt Software, then to Qt Development Frameworks. Qt has been developing rapidly since then and became the offcial SDK for Symbian and Meego System. 

In March 2011, Nokia sold the commercial licensing part of Qt to Digia creating Qt Commercial.

On August 9, 2012, Digia acquired Qt software technologies from Nokia.

## What Can We Do With Qt

### Write Cross-Platform Applications

Qt spports varities of platforms, from pc to embedded devices, from windows to *nix. So you can develop once and deploy everywhere.

- Officially supported platforms
	- Windows
	- Mac
	- Linux/X11
	- Symbian
	- Meego
	- Maemo
	- Embedded Linux
	- QNX
	- VxWorks (Digia Qt support only available for commercial licensees)
- supported by Communities
	- [IOS](http://www.qt-iphone.com/Introduction.html)
	- [Android](http://necessitas.kde.org/)
	- [WebOS](http://www.webos-internals.org/wiki/HowtoQt)
	- [Blackberry](http://qt-project.org/wiki/Blackberry)
	- [RaspberryPi](http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt-RaspberryPi) 
	
### Both OpenSource && Commerical

- License for Qt:
	- GPL
	- LGPL
	- Commerical
	
So, if you want to develop full opensource project such as linux kernel, you can ues the GPL liscense; if you want to develop commercial closed-source programs with Qt, you can use LGPL or Commerical License. This is very convenient.

You can get the source code of Qt [Here](http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt).

### Bindings for other languages

Don't know how to use C++ or you have your favourite one? No problem, Qt has a range of bindings for various languages that implement some or all of its feature set.

Here is a picture from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_\(framework\))
